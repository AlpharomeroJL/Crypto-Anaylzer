# Architecture audit

This folder holds **audit results** (findings, checklists, alignment reports), separate from `docs/spec/` which contains specifications and implementation plans.

- **spec/** — what we intend to build or have agreed to.
- **audit/** — what we found when checking the codebase/docs against those intents.

Use this folder for architecture audits, doc-upgrade checklists, and related artifacts.
